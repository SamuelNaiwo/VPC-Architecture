## What is VPC?

- A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a virtual network that closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center. An isolated space for privacy.

## Benefits of VPC?

- Security.
- Easy to deploy.
- Space saving.
- Seamless updates.
- Easy intergration.

## What is Internet Gateway?

- It is a VPC component that allows communication between your VPC and the internet.

## What is Subnet?

- A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC and resides in a single Availabilty Zone.

## What is CIDR?

- A range of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses that you set aside so that AWS can't assign them to your network interfaces.

## What are Route Tables?

- A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed.
